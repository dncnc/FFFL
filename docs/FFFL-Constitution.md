# ARTICLE 7

## DRAFT

**Section 1. Expansion Draft Order** – The draft order for any expansion drafts will be determined randomly by the roll of dice or by drawing names from a hat. An expansion draft will be conducted in a serpentine manner. For N teams drafting the draft picks in odd numbered rounds are selected in the order 1 through N. Even numbered rounds are reversed and selected N down to 1.

**Section 2. Regular Draft Order** – The first season’s draft order will be determined the same as an expansion draft. Every year after the initial year, the draft order will be the reverse of the previous season’s final rankings after the playoffs. Specifically, the bottom-tier playoff teams will be ranked reversed of their regular (note: not playoff) season standings (with the 14th team drafting first in the following draft). The top-tier playoff teams will be ranked reversed of their playoff finishes, with the Fantasy Bowl Champion drafting last. If a team changes owner, the new owner inherits the draft position earned by the previous owner.

**Section 3. Number of Rounds** – In the first season there will be sufficient rounds such that each team has a complete roster. Subsequent drafts will consist of N rounds to replace the N players lost at the end of the year as a result of roster reduction. If, as a result of draft trades, a team is left with more than N draft picks, they may all be used. Teams with less than N draft picks as a result of draft pick trades are allowed to pick at the end of the draft after all other teams have finished drafting to fill their roster to the required number of players. Any teams that are short draft choices and are drafting at the conclusion of the Nth round will draft in the order that they were seeded in during the regular draft.

**Section 4. Draft Pick Trading** – Draft picks for the initial league draft may not be traded. Draft picks for all future drafts may be traded for players currently on your roster or for other picks. Draft picks cannot be traded for money or other considerations.

**Section 4. Location, Date and Time** – The draft will be conducted the Sunday before the Labour Day weekend. If an owner cannot make the draft they may submit a draft list to the commissioner in advance or make arrangements for a designate to pick for them.

**Section 5. Time Limitations** – There will be time limits set for each round of the draft according to the following schedule.

| **Rounds 1 – 4**  | 60 seconds  |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Rounds 5 – 12** | 90 seconds  |
| **Rounds 13 +**   | 120 seconds |

# ARTICLE 8

## ROSTERS

**Section 1. Number of Players** – A standard roster shall have twenty-two players. In addition, each team has a three player Injured Reserve List and a two player Taxi Squad.

| **POSITION**         | **NUMBER** |
|----------------------|------------|
| QB                   | 2          |
| RB                   | 4          |
| WR                   | 4          |
| TE                   | 2          |
| K                    | 2          |
| D LINE               | 2          |
| LB                   | 2          |
| DB/SAFETY            | 2          |
| EXTRA (ANY POSITION) | 2          |

A team may exceed the maximum number of players after a draft but must cut the roster down to the maximum number of players one (1) week before the teams first game of the season.

**Section 2a. Injured Reserve List** – Each team will have three injured reserve slots. Once a player is moved to the IR by a team, he will not be able to return to active duty for the duration of the current season. An IR player may be or released or traded, however his IR status remains for the duration of the current season if acquired by another team through free agency or trade. The new team must make room for the IR player on that team’s IR squad. Each owner also has the option of waiving the injured player outright before sending him to IR, thereby releasing him to the free agent pool, or simply riding out the injury. A player must be listed as “out” in the NFL Injury Report before he may be placed on IR. In other words, this is a true IR squad and may not be used to simply hold on to players you don’t wish to play who are not injured.

**Section 2b. Taxi Squad** – Each team will have two player taxi squad for rookie players. A rookie player may be demoted to the taxi squad at any point during their rookie season, as long as they have not been used in a game and may remain on the taxi squad until the end of their second season. Players on the taxi squad may be carried over the following season in addition to the franchise's selected keeper players. A franchise must have an open roster position or create an open roster position to promote a player from the Taxi Squad to the active roster, and once promoted from the Taxi Squad a player may not be returned to the Taxi Squad. A player on the Taxi Squad that is not promoted to the active roster by the end of their second season may only be carried over to the following season by being identified by the Franchise owner as a Keeper player and thus implicitly promoted to an active roster position.

**Section 3. Position Eligibility** – Player position eligibility will be determined by what position the player is listed as at <http://www.nfl.com>, the official web site of the NFL. In the event of a player being listed in multiple positions, the player is available to be inserted in the starting lineup at any of the positions listed, provided that is what the owner lists him as.

**Section 4. Player Acquisition** – Players are acquired through the draft process at the start of each season and may be released or acquired through free agency and trading during the regular season.

**Section 5. Player Retention** – The FFFL is a keeper league, which means that all players acquired whether by draft, free agency, or trade may be kept from year to year. At the conclusion of each season each team may keep nine players as follows:

| **POSITION** | **NUMBER** |
|--------------|------------|
| QB           | 1          |
| RB           | 1          |
| WR           | 1          |
| TE           | 1          |
| K            | 1          |
| D LINE       | 1          |
| LB           | 1          |
| DB/SAFETY    | 1          |

This list of players must be submitted by the keeper date each year. The remaining players on each team's roster then become available as free agents and may be drafted at the next draft.

**Section 7. Player Contract Length** – No team may retain a player for more than three years.

**Section 8. Keeper Date** – (Added 09/09/15) The keeper date is now fixed each year as **August 25th. Keepers are due by 11:00pm on this date.**

**Section 9. Contract Resolution** – Contracts are tracked to the week. An NFL season consists of 17 weeks. A player acquired through an off-season trade or drafted will have contracts expire at the keeper date following the third season of play and must be traded by this time or else they will become available at the draft. Player contracts are tracked by season. Whether a player is acquired at the draft at the start of the season part-way through the season or in the final week of the season this counts as their first contract year. If a player is retained as a keeper into another season, then their contract year will increment by 1. Once a player’s contract year is 3 then the player may not be kept and must be traded prior to the keeper date or just dropped at the keeper date (not kept).

**Section 10. Expired Contracts** – Once a player's contract has expired, they must be released as free agents and are then available to be signed through the free agent waiver process. The team that was forced to drop the player is permitted to participate in the waiver process and may re-sign the released player. Not applicable anymore as contracts will not expire mid-season because they are no longer tracked by week (Starting with the 2019 season).

**Section 11. Designated Franchise Player** – Franchise player removed 2019.

# ARTICLE 9

## STARTING LINEUPS

**Section 1. Formation** – The starting lineup consists of ten players in accordance with the following table.

| 1 to 3 Wide Receivers \* | 1 Linebacker            |
| 1 to 3 Running Backs \*  | 1 Defensive Back/Safety |

**Section 2. Deadline** – The deadline for submitting a player to the starting lineup will be the gametime start for that player. Players are locked at the scheduled kickoff of their game. Partial lineups may be submitted for early games. starting lineups will be one hour before the start of the first Sunday game. If a team has starting players in a game that is taking place before Sunday, then only those players starting in these games must be declared at least one hour prior to the start of those games. The deadline for submitting starting lineups will be strictly enforced. Players not submitted before appropriate deadlines in games before Sunday will not be allowed to be included on a team’s starting lineup. (Updated for the 2019 season)

**Section 3. Submission** – Lineups may be submitted at the website or through the commissioner by e-mail, or phone (phone messages are okay). The Commissioner will always use the last valid lineup submitted as the team’s starting lineup. Therefore, a team may change their starting lineup at any time prior to the submission deadline.

**Section 4. Default Starting Lineup** – If an owner fails to submit a starting lineup by the deadline, then the lineup will default to the previous week’s lineup. That lineup will be used regardless of players being on bye weeks. If a player on the previous week’s lineup was traded or cut, then the owner will not receive any points from that player. For the first week of the season, a team will lose by default if no starting lineup is submitted by the appropriate deadline. If an illegal lineup is submitted, the lineup will be treated as invalid as a whole and therefore the previous week’s lineup will be used.

1.  At the start of each week if they are not on a fantasy team's roster.
2.  When they are released from a fantasy team's roster.
3.  When a new player is added to the player pool. (i.e. addition to an NFL roster)

    **Subsection 2. Minimum Waiver Period** - To be eligible for signing a player must be on waivers for a minimum of 3 days. This means players that become eligible for waivers after Monday will not be eligible to be signed until the waiver period the following week.

    **Subsection 3. Waiver Ranking** - After the Monday night game when all scores and stats are calculated each team will be assigned a waiver wire ranking. This value will be based on the team’s cumulative potential points for the season to date and will be posted on the league website with the weekly results.

A claim may be specified to be conditional on a previous claim being successful or not or implied as such by naming the same roster adjustments for multiple claims.

For example, consider the claim lists below.

List A

Claim \#1 - Sign RB Priest Holmes, release RB Shaun Alexander

Claim \#2 - Sign RB Jamal Lewis, release RB Shaun Alexander

By specifying Alexander to be released in both cases it is implied that Lewis should only be signed if the Holmes claim is unsuccessful.

List B

Claim \#1 - Sign RB Priest Holmes, release RB Shaun Alexander

Claim \#2 - Sign RB Jamal Lewis, release RB Clinton Portis conditional on claim \#1 failing.

By specifying a condition for claim \#2, it will only be processed if claim \#1 fails.

List C

Claim \#1 - Sign RB Priest Holmes, release RB Shaun Alexander

Claim \#2 - Sign RB Jamal Lewis, release RB Clinton Portis.

No conditions are stated or implied thus if both claims are successful both Holmes and Lewis will be signed and both Alexander and Portis will be released.

**Subsection 7. Claim Results** - Waiver claims will be processed and posted to the website on Wednesday at 11PM.

**Subsection 8. Free Agent Pool** - If a player clears waivers without being signed, he moves into the free agent pool and may be picked up on a first come first serve basis anytime between Thursday 6PM and one hour prior to the deadline for starting lineups that week.

The Commissioner will then notify the CW and each side will present their positions to the CW via e-mail or through postings on the website. The CW will then discuss the issue and deliver a final ruling.
